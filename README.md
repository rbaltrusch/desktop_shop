# Desktop Shop

This is a mock shop application, running completely offline on a desktop. The graphical interface connects with a generated, local database of customers, products and transactions (Python / SQLite3). As the application runs completely offline, it does away with any networking or server complexity and showcases a bare implementation of an application interfacing with a production database.

Here are some snippets of the user interface:
