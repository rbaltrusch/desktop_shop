# How to use

## Query database

The file query_database.py is provided to explore the contents of the main.db database without authentification.
A number of example functions are provided in the file to query the contents of the users, transactions and products tables.

To run the file, open a terminal and run the following commands:
```
cd tools
python query_database.py
```

## Update database

The file update_database.py is provided when changes to some or all the data in the database need to be made internally, such as when changing the format of some of the data in it.
Outside of that, it has little use and should be used sparingly.
